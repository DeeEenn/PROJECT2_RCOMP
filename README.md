## Project Overview

A secure file sharing system with a Java-based server and client implementation. The system supports file operations, compression, and secure communication.

## Server Architecture

### Core Components

#### FileServer.java
Main server class that handles:
- Server initialization and startup
- Client connection management
- Authentication
- File slot management

Key features:
- Configurable port (default: 8080)
- User authentication system
- Concurrent file slot management (max 10 slots)
- Multi-threaded client handling

#### ClientHandler.java
Handles individual client connections:
- Client request processing
- File operations execution
- Response management
- Thread-safe operations

#### FileSlot.java
Manages individual file slots:
- File metadata storage
- File state tracking
- Slot availability management

### Protocol Implementation

#### Protocol.java
Defines communication protocol constants:

**Request Commands:**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `AUTH` | Authentication request |
| `LIST` | List files |
| `UPLOAD` | Upload file |
| `DOWNLOAD` | Download file |
| `DELETE` | Delete file |
| `MOVE` | Move file |
| `RENAME` | Rename file |
| `STATS` | Get server statistics |
| `COMPRESS` | Compress file |

**Response Commands:**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `OK` | Operation successful |
| `ERROR` | Operation failed |
| `AUTH_OK` | Authentication successful |
| `AUTH_FAIL` | Authentication failed |

### Security Features

#### SSLServer.java
Implements secure communication:
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Certificate management
- Secure socket handling

### Utility Classes

#### CompressionUtil.java
Handles file compression:
- File compression algorithms
- Compression ratio management
- Decompression utilities

#### Logger.java
Logging system:
- Operation logging
- Error tracking
- Debug information

#### ProgressTracker.java
Tracks file transfer progress:
- Upload progress monitoring
- Download progress monitoring
- Transfer statistics

#### ServerStats.java
Server statistics management:
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage tracking
- Operation statistics

#### TransferManager.java
Manages file transfers:
- Transfer queue management
- Bandwidth control
- Transfer prioritization

```

## Dependencies

The project uses Maven for dependency management. Key dependencies include:
- Java 11 or higher
- SSL/TLS libraries for secure communication
- Compression libraries for file operations

## Configuration

The server can be configured through the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Port | Server port number | 8080 |
| Max Slots | Maximum number of file slots | 10 |
| Username | Authentication username | admin |
| Password | Authentication password | password |

## Usage

### Starting the Server
```java
FileServer server = new FileServer(port, username, password);
server.start();
```

### Client Authentication
```
AUTH|username|password
```

### File Operations

#### 1. List Files
```
LIST
```

#### 2. Upload File
```
UPLOAD|filename|filesize|data
```

#### 3. Download File
```
DOWNLOAD|filename
```

#### 4. Delete File
```
DELETE|filename
```

#### 5. Move File
```
MOVE|source|destination
```

#### 6. Rename File
```
RENAME|oldname|newname
```

#### 7. Get Statistics
```
STATS
```

#### 8. Compress File
```
COMPRESS|filename
```

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- Authentication failures
- File operation errors
- Network communication issues
- Resource limitations
- Invalid requests

## Security Considerations

- All communications are encrypted using SSL/TLS
- User authentication is required for all operations
- File operations are validated and sanitized
- Resource usage is monitored and limited
- Concurrent operations are thread-safe

## Performance

The system is designed for optimal performance:
- Concurrent file operations
- Efficient file transfer management
- Resource usage optimization
- Compression for bandwidth efficiency
- Caching mechanisms

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:
- Additional compression algorithms
- Enhanced security features
- Improved error recovery
- Extended protocol capabilities
- Performance optimizations
